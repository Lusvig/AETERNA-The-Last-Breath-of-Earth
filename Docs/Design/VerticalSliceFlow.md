**Moment 2: Sarah's Body in Louvre**

- Temporary hallucination stop (if any active)

- Player has met herd
- Player has made an NPC choice

**The flood sequence:**

**Phase 1: Initial Rise (0:00-5:00)**
- Water level rises at 10 units/sec
- Sound design: distant roar of water
- Radiation hum increases (underwater sources contaminating)

- Oxygen system becomes CRITICAL if player immersed

**Mechanical pressure:**
- Player must reach high ground (Eiffel Tower, upper Louvre)

- **Choice B**: Escape alone, leave them (moral -10, -2.0 moral weight)
- **Choice C**: Make final stand, try to lead herd to safety (moral +20, complex rescue)

**Ending state depends on:**
- All choices made throughout slice
- Compassion score (sum of all moral choices)
- Environmental choices (did you kill animals? Burn forest?)
- Trust ratio with NPC (how many times did you help vs. betray?)
- Trauma level (witnessed death, isolation, PTSD from drowning)
- Sanity level (hallucinations? Breakdown?)
