# AETERNA: The 27 Endings Framework

## Overview

AETERNA's ending system is built on a sophisticated calculation engine that evaluates 500+ player choices across 4 major axes, resulting in 27 unique, mutually exclusive endings. No ending is "good" or "bad"—each is a reflection of the player's journey and values.

## The 4 Decision Axes

### Axis 1: Compassion (0–100)
Measures how often the player prioritized helping others over self-interest.

**Idealist** (76–100): Consistently saved lives, shared resources, helped strangers
**Balanced** (26–75): Mixed approach, sometimes helped, sometimes took practical steps
**Pragmatist** (0–25): Prioritized personal survival, looted bodies, made harsh choices

### Axis 2: Environmental Impact (-100 to 100)
Measures the player's conservation vs. exploitation of natural resources.

**Caretaker** (51–100): Preserved forests, didn't hunt excessively, protected ecosystems
**Neutral** (26–50): Balanced use of resources
**Despoiler** (-100 to 25): Burned forests for warmth, overhunted, destroyed habitats

### Axis 3: Violence Level (0+)
Counts total NPCs/creatures killed and the context of those kills.

**Pacifist** (0–5 kills): Talked through conflicts, avoided violence
**Realist** (6–50 kills): Used violence when necessary but not gratuitously
**Killer** (51+ kills): Embraced violence as primary solution

### Axis 4: Trust/Betrayal Ratio (0–1)
Measures whether player kept promises and built relationships or exploited others.

**Ally** (0.7+): Kept promises, helped friends, built community
**Complex** (0.4–0.7): Mixed interactions, balanced gains and losses
**Traitor** (<0.4): Betrayed companions, exploited others, took from allies

## Ending Calculation System

### Pseudocode
```cpp
float CalculateEndingIndex(FAeternaGameState GameState) {
    // Normalize scores
    float compassionTier = GameState.CompassionScore / 100.0f; // 0-1
    float envTier = (GameState.EnvironmentalScore + 100) / 200.0f; // 0-1
    float violenceTier = min(GameState.KillCount / 50.0f, 1.0f); // 0-1
    float trustTier = GameState.TrustRatio; // 0-1
    
    // Generate 4-dimensional weight vector
    float weights[4] = {compassionTier, envTier, violenceTier, trustTier};
    
    // Find closest ending in 4D space
    int bestEnding = 0;
    float bestDistance = INFINITY;
    
    for (int ending = 0; ending < 27; ending++) {
        float distance = Calculate4DDistance(weights, EndingProfiles[ending]);
        if (distance < bestDistance) {
            bestDistance = distance;
            bestEnding = ending;
        }
    }
    
    return bestEnding;
}
```
