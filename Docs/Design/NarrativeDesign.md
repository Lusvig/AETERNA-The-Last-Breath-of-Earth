# AETERNA: Narrative Design Document

## Overview

AETERNA's narrative is not delivered through cutscenes or exposition. It emerges from systems—the world *is* the story. The player's experience is shaped by:

1. **Environmental Storytelling**: Abandoned homes, mass graves, art installations in dead cities
2. **Memory Echoes**: Photorealistic flashbacks of dead NPCs' final moments
3. **NPC Relationships**: Complex, dynamic interactions with 35+ characters
4. **The Legacy System**: Player choices permanently alter world state and ending
5. **Atmospheric Immersion**: Sound design, weather, creatures all tell stories

## Narrative Arc

### Act 1: Realization (Days 1–90)
**Theme**: "The world is dead, and so are you—you just haven't noticed yet."

Player begins journey from Paris (safe but claustrophobic) toward evacuation point, slowly realizing:
- There are almost no other humans left
- Those who survive are often broken or dangerous
- Your supplies are finite
- The world itself is hostile

### Act 2: Adaptation (Days 91–180)
**Theme**: "Can you save others, or only yourself?"

Player encounters organized settlements, trade networks, moral dilemmas:
- Should you join a community or move on?
- Is it ethical to abandon people you could help?
- What's the cost of survival?

### Act 3: Acceptance (Days 181–275)
**Theme**: "What does it mean to witness the end?"

Player approaches evacuation point and chooses their ending:
- Board the Ark (humanity's last chance, but corrupt)
- Stay behind and build new society
- Sabotage the Ark (mercy killing for species)
- Merge with nature (transcendence)

### Echo Example: "Sarah's Last Day" (Full Script)

**Location**: Notre-Dame Cathedral, flooded lower level  
**Character**: Sarah Chen, 34, Marine Biologist  
**Duration**: 6:45

---

**[0:00]** Interior of Notre-Dame cathedral. Bioluminescent organisms glow softly in the water. Sarah Chen in wetsuit, examining creatures through a magnifying device.

**SARAH (V.O.)**: "Day 427 since contact. The organisms are accelerating their reproductive cycle. I don't think I ever considered I'd be witnessing speciation happen in real-time. Evolution on fast-forward."

**[1:20]** Sarah sits on a dry platform, reading a message on a waterproof device. Her face crumples. Hands shaking.

**SARAH (V.O.)**: "Got the message from the settlement. Emma's... Emma's been gone for two weeks. They just told me now."

*[Long pause. Sarah weeps silently.]*

**SARAH (V.O.)**: "She was trying to reach me. The message said she was heading north, looking for the research team. She never made it."

**[3:15]** Sarah stands at the cathedral's edge, looking at the water. The bioluminescence is beautiful—otherworldly.

**SARAH (V.O.)**: "There's nothing left in the world except this. These creatures. They're thriving in the ruins. Evolution doesn't care about beauty or tragedy—it just adapts and continues."

**[4:45]** Sarah makes a decision. She begins to disrobe, preparing to enter the water.

**SARAH (V.O.)**: "I can't reach Emma in the world above. But maybe I can be useful down here. Maybe I can understand what's happening to life itself. That's something."

**[5:30]** Sarah wades into the glowing water. The bioluminescent creatures swirl around her—not aggressive, almost curious.

**SARAH (V.O.)**: "If humanity is gone, maybe I can at least witness what comes next. That feels like a life worth finishing."

**[6:15]** The camera pulls back as Sarah floats deeper, surrounded by glowing creatures, peaceful expression on her face.

**SARAH (V.O.)**: "Evolution continues. So do I."

**[6:45]** Screen fades. The echo ends.

### Player Interaction After Echo

Player stands over Sarah's body in the cathedral, finding:
- **Journal (readable)**: Detailed research notes, emotional entries about Emma
- **Memory Device (quest item)**: Unlocks "Sarah's Research" codex entry
- **Environmental Sample Kit (valuable resource)**: Needed for certain crafting
- **Her Body (moral choice)**:
  - Leave it with respect (spiritual satisfaction, no resources)
  - Take her equipment (practical, slight sanity cost)
  - Bury her (time cost, significant sanity boost)
  - Consume her (extreme survival choice, major sanity penalty)

**Consequences**:
- If player continues Sarah's research: Gains "Naturalist" reputation, can make alliances with scientist NPCs
- If player loots without respect: Word spreads, some NPCs distrust you
- If player gives her funeral: Settlements hear of your compassion, gain trust

## Dynamic Dialogue System

### Context-Aware Responses

NPC dialogue changes based on:
- Current survival stats (NPCs notice if you're starving, injured, insane)
- Previous interactions (memory of past help/harm)
- Your reputation (settlements spread word about who you are)
- Your appearance (blood-stained, frostbite, radiation burns)
- Time of day and weather (moods change)

### Example Dialogue Tree: Marcus (Settlement Leader)

```
PLAYER APPROACHES

If (PlayerReputation < -30) →
  MARCUS: "You're not welcome here. You've brought nothing but chaos."
  - [Intimidate] "Your people need me more than you."
  - [Negotiate] "I know what I've done. Let me make amends."
  - [Leave] (Exit dialogue)

If (PlayerReputation between -30 and 30) →
  MARCUS: "I've heard things about you. Some good, some... not."
  - [Question] "What exactly have you heard?"
  - [Redirect] "What matters is what I do next."
  - [Trade] "I'm just here for supplies."

If (PlayerReputation > 30) →
  MARCUS: "You're the one everyone's talking about. I'm... impressed."
  - [Direct] "I need your help with something important."
  - [Personal] "How are you holding up with the leadership?"
  - [Alliance] "We should work together."

If (PLAYER HAS SEEN MARCUS'S MEMORY ECHO) →
  [New Option] "I know what happened with the family you sacrificed."
  - [Compassionate] "You made an impossible choice. I don't judge you."
    → Marcus gains +50 trust, reveals secrets
  - [Accusatory] "You're a murderer. You don't deserve leadership."
    → Marcus becomes hostile, may lead to combat
```

## Environmental Storytelling

### Paris Example: Notre-Dame

**Pre-Collapse State**: Sacred cathedral, millions of annual visitors

**Post-Collapse State (2087)**:
- Lower level flooded by risen Seine water (8 meters)
- Upper levels reclaimed by vines, bioluminescent organisms growing on stonework
- Tourist shops looted of supplies
- Homeless camp evidence in upper galleries
- Mass grave beneath the altar (40+ bodies)
- Sarah Chen's research station in the crypt
- Final holdouts' remains (recent, 2–3 weeks old)

**Discoverable Stories**:
- Tourist backpack with final diary entry (2085): "We made it to Paris. My wife is sick. Hoping Notre-Dame is safe. It's beautiful even in death."
- Wedding rings scattered in the nave (lovers who sought refuge)
- Children's drawings on walls (hope vs. despair)
- Scientific research scattered in crypt (Sarah's work)
- Blood trails indicating violence/struggle
- Organized camp layout suggesting coordinated habitation

**Player Interaction**:
- Can read all discoverable items
- Environmental clues affect survival options (water source, shelter, food sources)
- Disturbing the sites has moral weight (grave robbing carries psychological cost)

---

## Codex & Lore System

Players discover lore through:
- **Readable Items**: Letters, journals, scientific notes, newspaper clippings
- **Codex Entries**: Automatically recorded context about the world
- **Audio Logs**: Recorded messages from before collapse
- **Environmental Details**: Building names, billboards, signs reveal history
- **NPC Stories**: Dialogue and Memory Echoes explain how people survived/died

Example Codex Entries:
- "The Last News Broadcast" (transcript from final global transmission, 2080)
- "Methane Burst Timeline" (scientific explanation of what's killing Earth)
- "The Evacuation Program" (history of the secret Ark project)
- "Climate Cascade Theory" (why everything collapsed so suddenly)
